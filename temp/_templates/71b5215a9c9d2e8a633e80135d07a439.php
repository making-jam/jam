			<p><strong>Build Something Meaningful</strong></p>
			<p>The new technologies of digital design and rapid prototyping have changed the way the world creates. This is the age of the maker. New tools combined with passion, creativity and innovation have the potential to solve some of the worldâ€™s greatest challenges. We want to encourage people to avoid working on products that solve superficial problems to focus on those that have real impact.</p>
			<p><strong>Art + Engineering + More</strong></p>
			<p>The best products are a balanced blend of art and technology. We do not favour one discipline over another. Jam is about the magic that happens when different ideas and skills meet.</p>
			<p><strong>Artists Steal</strong></p>
			<p>The best ideas are often improvements of old or existing ideas. Rather than reinvent the wheel, we believe in learning from the best.</p>
